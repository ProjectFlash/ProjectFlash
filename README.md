## Overview
### Description
Project Flash is a study aid app that allows students to create and view public flashcard sets in a variety of subjects. Users can share, create and save flash card sets offline to their devices.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education/Acadamic
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily meant for mobile but integrating a website is possible as the data is saved to a database. 
- **Story:** Allows user to view study sets as well as show them different categories for their desired subject. Users can also rate the quality of sets. 
- **Market:** The general market is towards students of any ages as well as anyone who wants to learn or memorize concepts.
- **Habit:** The app would be used relativley often for those who need to study for an exam or who need quick refference for a speech.
- **Scope:** We would start with the focus on user creating flash cards for their studies. Adding social aspects such as commenting, sharing the card sets could potentially evolve the app an academic online learning commnity.
